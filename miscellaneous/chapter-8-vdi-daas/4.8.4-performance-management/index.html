Performance Management</h1><p>Performance ranks high in VDI operations so let&rsquo;s start with it. Horizon is a complex architecture with many components and layer. How do you know Horizon is performing?</p><p>One good way to answer is to begin with the end in mind. The purpose of DaaS is to provide acceptable user experience. To deliver that, there are 3 components (Edge, Network, Data Center) that must work well. Horizon is a client/server architecture, meaning it has a Horizon Client software that runs at the edge, talking via the network to a server agent software residing in the data center.</p><p><img src=4.8.4-fig-1.png alt=Connectivity></p><p>The client software does the screen rendering. Due to lack of contention and utilization metrics, we can&rsquo;t measure its performance. Some thin client or zero client has a tiny OS that support syslog.</p><p>The network consists of the protocol and the physical network. Typically, the physical network carries more than Horizon protocol. For example, you have IP telephony system, security cameras or remote servers in your branches. You need to have visibility at the consumer (Horizon protocol) level and provider (physical network) level. In most cases, the network is not owned by the EUC team, so EUC team is consuming a shared service. Because of this, the physical network metrics play the supporting role. They are not primary metrics used in the KPI.</p><p>The data center part is where the bulk of EUC component resides. This includes both VMware and non-VMware components.</p><p>The network part and the data center part are two independent parts, typically managed by different teams. You can have network problem without the data center problem, and vice versa. By separating them as separate KPI, you can see what kind of problems you have and do the necessary follow up. By combining them, you can potentially lose visibility as the good one can mask the bad one.</p><p>Be mindful of the difference between the <strong>user has performance problem</strong> and the <strong>user causes performance problem</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Duality of users</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Victim</strong></td><td>The user experiences problem.<br>Contention is high, utilization is low. Not getting work done, so productivity is impacted.<br>User is upset.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Villain</strong></td><td>The user causes performance problem.<br>Utilization is very high. Contention is irrelevant in this case. The user may get a lot of work done.<br>Other users could be affected, so you are upset.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=network-kpi>Network KPI</h2><p>This is easier to measure as it has fewer metrics and only has 1 type of resource.</p><p><img src=4.8.4-fig-2.png alt=KPI></p><p>The latency is measured at PCoIP or Blast protocol layer, not TCP/UDP layer. Upper layer is more accurate as we can have packet loss at application-layer but Windows sees no dropped packet. The reason was the packet arrives out of order and hence unusable from Horizon viewpoint.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve set the threshold value to be conservative yet realistic. If your users are accessing over the WAN or unreliable connection, then you may not see green. This is acceptable so long user actual productivity is not impacted.</p><p>Time taken to load the user profile and time taken to logon are not included in the KPI because they are one time value. KPI needs to be a metric that can be evaluated regularly.</p><p>At this moment, we do not include variance in the latency. If you think we should, do recommend the value for each threshold.</p><p>The session network utilization is not part of the KPI as we can&rsquo;t put the value into the range. The <a href=https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/blast-extreme-display-protocol-vmware-horizon-7>Blast Extreme</a> protocol may be doing minimal work at that time for that user, so a low network throughput may not indicate poor user experience.</p><h2 id=data-center-kpi>Data Center KPI</h2><p>The DC KPI depends on the types of object. A user can have VDI Session or RDS Session, served by VDI Pool and RDS Farm respectively.</p><table><thead><tr><th>KPI</th><th>Consideration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>VDI Session</strong></td><td>It has contention metrics. As it’s Windows OS running on a vSphere VM, it has metrics from both layers.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RDS Session</strong></td><td>It does not have contention metrics. It only has utilization metrics and they cannot be used to determine if a user experience degrades.<br>This applies to both application session and desktop session. As a result, the KPI is taken from the RDS Host, which is a server VM serving many users concurrently. The drawback is RDS Host does not provide visibility into the performance of each session.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since both RDS Host and VDI Session is basically a Window VM, we are using the same KPI. Other than RDSH specific counter such as <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-rdsh-performance-counters>this one</a>, there is no application level specific counters to measure contention. vRealize Operations uses the following counters and threshold to form the KPI.</p><p><img src=4.8.4-fig-3.png alt=Counters></p><p>The counters above are layered into 4, matching the layer used in performance troubleshooting. Look at the contention metrics first, then the utilization type.</p><p>We provide the threshold as they reflect Horizon best practice, which should work for most customers. Your situation may differ, which is why we provide the raw metrics too as the KPI metric cannot be modified.</p><p>The CPU Queue Length is the total queue length. In future, we may convert it into per vCPU. Same with disk latency, as read and write can move independantly.</p><p>We do not include CPU Context Switch and Disk Outstanding IO, as I&rsquo;m not yet convinced on the threshold, based on the profiling data. The numbers vary too wide. Send me your profiling result so I can consider it too.</p><p>We do not include CPU Overlap as the value is negligible most of the time. It will be green most of the time, hence inflating the value unnecessarily.</p><p>Do you know why we include Page-in but not Page-out? How about balloon, swapped and compressed? How come none of them are here? Refer to Part 2 Memory chapter for the answer.</p><p>We do not include Memory In Use as we have Free Memory. In Use is better for capacity, while Free is better for performance.</p><p>VM CPU utilization is included because it&rsquo;s possible that we have a runaway process that it&rsquo;s impacting user performance. A runaway process typically consumes 1 vCPU so if the VM has 4 CPU the increase is only 25%.</p><p>Now that we have the DC KPI and Network KPI at the smallest object, we can roll up to higher level object. For that, we need a correct hierarchy. The hierarchy is also required by other pillar of operations management.</p><h2 id=kpi-roll-up>KPI Roll Up</h2><p>Using the above as the foundation, we can build the KPI at higher level object. Here is how we do it.</p><p><img src=4.8.4-fig-4.png alt=Rollup></p><p>Each VDI session has 2 KPI: Network KPI and Data Center KPI.</p><p>The VDI Pool Network KPI is simply the average of all its VDI Session Network KPI. While average is a lagging indicator, it best represents the entire reality, which is required for further roll up to the higher level object. We certainly will complement it with leading indicators.</p><p>The VDI Pool DC KPI is also the average of its session DC KPI. Because these 2 KPIs operate independantly, we do <em>not</em> combine them.</p><p>For RDS, the correponding object is RDS Farm, not RDS Host. It&rsquo;s more logical to monitor at this level, just like we monitor at vSphere cluster level and not the individual ESXi. Just like a VM moves within a cluster, a user does not always get the same RDS host in the next session. We take the network KPI from RDS sessions and DC KPI from RDS hosts.</p><p>We combine both the VDI and RDS KPI at the Pod level. Again, we simply take the average of both. If you have more VDI Pools than RDS Farms, then the Pod KPI value will be driven by the VDI part of your architecture.</p><p><code>Pod DC KPI = Average (VDI Pool DC KPI, RDS Farm DC KPI)</code></p><p>The limitation of the above is it each pools and farms are given the same weightage. The number of sessions do not matter. The reason is you manage at pool and farm level, not individual session.</p><p>The KPI for higher level objects cannot be the average of Pod KPI, as Pod is basically a group. The KPI is still taken from VDI Pool and RDS Farm levels, as these objects provide the resource. This is to ensure fair representation if you have Pod of different size.</p><p><code>Horizon World DC KPI = Average (VDI Pool DC KPI, RDS Farm DC KPI)</code></p><p>We do <em>not</em> include the Horizon server infrastructure at the KPI level. The reason is they are supporting metrics. They do <em>not</em> directly measure the user experience as none of their counters are session-specific. This is an example where we&rsquo;re being careful in choosing KPI. Each KPI is ideally a primary metric, directly measuring the session performance. If you include supporting metrics, you can get false positive or false negative.</p><h2 id=leading-indicator>Leading Indicator</h2><p>We covered in Part 1 Chapter 2 Performance Management that you need a leading indicator. The true KPI is a lagging indicator, so we need to complement it. The roll up technique matters so you balance the information.</p><p>A Pod can have thousands of sessions, so how do you roll up?</p><ul><li>Each session has a KPI (%). This is a balanced approach, so we can take its value.</li><li>At Farm or Pool level, if you take the worst among sessions, the value may be bad most of the time. A better way is to take the 95th percentile, and then complement with a count of sessions in the red.</li><li>At Pod level, take the same approach, which is 95th percentile, complemented with a count of sessions in the red</li></ul><p><img src=4.8.4-fig-5.png alt="Roll up and indicator"></p><p>Using the above, here are the KPI metrics we have at the top level</p><ul><li>95th Percentile Pod DC KPI = 95th Percentile of all its (Farm KPIs, Pool KPIs) values</li><li>95th Percentile World DC KPI. Identical formula to Pod, so expect this to be lower than the average of all pods</li><li>95th Percentile Pod Network KPI. Same approach with DC KPI, but obviously using Network KPI as input.</li><li>95th Percentile World Network KPI. You got the idea.</li></ul><p>Yes, just 2 each for Pod and World, and 2 each for DC and Network. You need to keep it minimum so it&rsquo;s easier to see over time.</p><p>At the Farm and Pool level, it&rsquo;s the same approach.</p><ul><li>95th Percentile Farm DC KPI = 95th Percentile of all its RDS Hosts DC KPI values</li><li>95th Percentile Farm Network KPI. Same approach with DC KPI, but obviously using Network KPI as input.</li><li>95th Percentile Pool DC KPI. Same approach with RDS Farm, but obviously using VDI Session DC KPI as input.</li><li>95th Percentile Pod Network KPI. You got the idea.</li></ul><p>Now that we have the KPI, let&rsquo;s look at the Horizon objects one by one, starting with the smallest/lowest one. We will also include all other performance metrics to complete the picture. To keep the list short and topic manageable, we will not include non performance metrics and properties. We will cover them separately.</p><h2 id=baseline-profiling>Baseline Profiling</h2><p>Horizon is one of the largest applications in a company, as it can span thousands of VMs and locations. It&rsquo;s important to profile so you know what to expect. Different deployments can have a different performance characteristics, making it hard to establish best practice threshold. In a large scale deployment, different pools or farms can have different numbers. If your design expects a different performance for certain farm or pool, then profile them separately.</p><p>Take time to profile your actual environment while it&rsquo;s healthy so you have a baseline.</p><p>We cover the profiling technique earlier in <a href=/operations-management/chapter-2-performance-management/1.2.10-baseline-profiling/>Part 1 Chapter 2</a>. Specific for Horizon, you should profile the following counters.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Object</th><th>Counters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>RDS Session</strong></td><td>Disk IOPS<br>Frame Rate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RDS Host</strong></td><td>CPU Queue<br>CPU Context Switch<br>Memory Page-in Rate<br>Disk Queue<br>Disk Outstanding IO<br>Read IOPS and Write IOPS. Profile them side by side, and compare both against expectation.<br>CPU Usage and Memory Usage. Compare against plan.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RDS Farm</strong></td><td>Read IOPS and Write IOPS. Profile them side by side, and compare against expectation.<br>CPU Usage in MHz. Make sure this number is within what the cluster can provide. Check the average does not exceed your sizing.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VDI Session</strong></td><td>Same sets of metrics as RDS Host, as both are just VMs. You need to profile separately as your desktop pattern may differ to your server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VDI Pool</strong></td><td>Same sets of metrics as RDS Farm, as both are just collection of VMs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connection Server</strong></td><td>Same sets of metrics as RDS Host. You need to profile separately as their pattern may differ. The profiling will also be useful after a major upgrade. For example:<br><ul><li>If the new version is supposed to deliver 10% performance improvement, does the reality support it?<br><li>If the new version delivers 2x scalability but at cost of 1.5x footprint, what do you actually get in your own environment? The lab may not be identical to your real world situation.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horizon World</strong></td><td>Disk IOPS. Make sure this number is within what your storage subsystem can handle.<br>Network Bandwidth. Make sure this number is well within what your WAN link can handle, as majority of traffic is non-protocol traffic.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As part of the baselining, you will know the typical size of a session, a user, an RDS Host. They form the building block for your sizing. Compare these numbers against the numbers you put in your sizing document (during the time you architected the system).
